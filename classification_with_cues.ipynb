    "- **Providing Empathy (Label: 2)** – Defined as experiencing and understanding the feelings of another and acting accordingly.\n",
    "- **None (Label: 0)** – Conversations that do not seek or provide empathy. These are straightforward, fact-oriented exchanges.\n",

    "  - negative = Negative sentiment.\n",
    "  - positive = Positive sentiment.\n",
    "  - neutral = Neutral sentiment.\n",

    "  - 0 = Weak (no explicit emotional label).\n",
    "  - 1 = Strong (explicit emotional response, e.g., \"I feel sad for you\").\n",

    "  - 0 = Weak (generic acknowledgment, e.g., \"I understand how you feel\").\n",
    "  - 1 = Strong (specific inference, e.g., \"This must be terrifying\" or descriptions of similar experiences).\n",
    "- **Explorations** (range: [0, 1]) – Assesses how well the the person who could provide empathy helps the person who seeks empathy explore their emotions:\n",
