    "\n",
    "- **Seeking Empathy (Label: 1)** – Defined as a wanting to be heard and understood. People need their negative feelings recognized and acknowledged in challenging situations and their positive emotions understood and vicariously shared\n",
    "- **Providing Empathy (Label: 2)** – Defined as experiencing and understanding the feelings and emotions (negative and positive) of another and communicating accordingly\n",
    "- **None (Label: 0)** – Conversations that do not seek or provide empathy. These are straightforward, fact-oriented utterances.\n",

    "- **Arousal** (range: -1 to 1) – Reflects the emotional intensity of a person (-1 = very calm, 1 = highly aroused).\n",
    "- **Valence** (range: -1 to 1) – Indicates emotional polarity (-1 = very negative, 1 = very positive).\n",

    "- **Sentiment** label – Identifies polarity:\n",
    "  - negative = Negative sentiment.\n",
    "  - positive = Positive sentiment.\n",
    "  - neutral = Neutral sentiment.\n",
    "- **Emotional Reactions** (range: [0, 2]) – Measures emotional expressiveness in the person who could provide empathy response:\n",
    "  - 0 = Does not allude to any emotion.\n",
    "  - 1 = Weak (no explicit emotional label).\n",
    "  - 2 = Strong (explicit emotional response, e.g., \"I feel sad for you\").\n",
    "- **Interpretations** (range: [0, 1]) – Evaluates how well the person who could provide empathy demonstrates understanding:\n",
    "  - 0 = No expression of understanding.\n",
    "  - 1 = Weak (generic acknowledgment, e.g., \"I understand how you feel\").\n",
    "  - 2 = Strong (specific inference, e.g., \"This must be terrifying\" or descriptions of similar experiences).\n",
    "- **Explorations** (range: [0, 1]) – Assesses how well the the person who could provide empathy helps the person who seeks empathy explore their emotions:\n",
