    "- **Seeking Empathy (Label: 1)** – Defined as a wanting to be heard and understood. People need their negative feelings recognized and acknowledged in challenging situations and their positive emotions understood and vicariously shared\n",
    "- **Providing Empathy (Label: 2)** – Defined as experiencing and understanding the feelings and emotions (negative and positive) of another and communicating accordingly\n",
    "- **None (Label: 0)** – Conversations that do not seek or provide empathy. These are straightforward, fact-oriented utterances.\n",

    "  - negative = Negative sentiment.\n",
    "  - positive = Positive sentiment.\n",
    "  - neutral = Neutral sentiment.\n",
    "- **Emotional Reactions** (range: [0, 2]) – Measures emotional expressiveness in the person who could provide empathy response:\n",
    "  - 0 = Does not allude to any emotion.\n",
    "  - 1 = Weak (no explicit emotional label).\n",
    "  - 2 = Strong (explicit emotional response, e.g., \"I feel sad for you\").\n",

    "  - 0 = No expression of understanding.\n",
    "  - 1 = Weak (generic acknowledgment, e.g., \"I understand how you feel\").\n",
    "  - 2 = Strong (specific inference, e.g., \"This must be terrifying\" or descriptions of similar experiences).\n",
