I feel like I could trust him then.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ,That sounds very interesting.

sub_11_conv_4 ,yeah I did end up complaining actually the manager wasn't that helpful they were also telling me that I had was trying to scam the restaurant which made me more mad because I think that they were trying to cover for the for the cook who did that and it just kind of ruined the reputation of that restaurant for me                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ,right I get it Maybe some people try to actually cheat and do what they thought you was doing.

sub_11_conv_4 ,I think it's more like a tactic. I don't think it's like that common that people scam and I think that's really really bad behavior on the part of the of the restaurants because even if someone is trying to scam like the restaurant it's still like something that they should take into account and I don't think you can fake a hair inside of the food                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ,"Right, so you had the evidence.

sub_12_conv_3 ,I've been feeling bad the whole morning. I even have a headache because I cannot sleep well. And it's just because of my noisy neighbors. They cannot stop making noise every night until late night. And I don't know what to do. I talk to them and they don't change. They continue being just very loud at night.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ,I'm sorry to hear that but I also don't know what to do for you.

sub_13_conv_2 ,"For here it's really important to have everything perfectly clean, but for me it's not like that. So I prefer spending time in other things like playing video games. but I guess I need to have like a balance not not only playing all the time at least that's what she wants and I'm also trying to to do it because it's good for me and for for us but I couldn't this time like last week I just play video games"                                                                                                                                                                            ,I think when living with other person it can be difficult and talking it's very important for the relationship so if you cannot maybe understand each other probably in the future it can be harder in other things like having if you get more serious like having maybe child or getting marriage could be more complicated so but yeah but living with your girlfriend it's a good step just to kind of test in the relationship so I think you shouldn't worry about who cleans but if you are having a bad life maybe you need to resolve this.   ,      2
sub_13_conv_2 ,Okay so I think everything so far is going good and I don't want to screw this up. That's why even though for me I think the house is okay even though it's a bit messy I want to have a good relationship with her and in the future like even to think about something more serious with her so that's that's why I feel a bit disappointed about myself this week I couldn't spend the time to work in the house but at the same time in our relationship                                                                                                                                          ,"Yeah well everybody needs its own space. So I think for the common places in the house, maybe it should be better to share the responsibilities of some days who decides who cleans that area. for example if you have your own space I think it's totally fine if you have your things as you as you want"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ,      2
sub_13_conv_2 ,makes total sense I didn't think about that but if we share a space then in that case both of us should be able to feel comfortable being there but if it's a space just for me and I don't mind the clutter that should be fine and then at least I will try to clean the the spaces that we share before she comes back tomorrow                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ,yeah I think it's always very important to talk so talk to her and and explain then maybe he can understand you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ,      2

I've been playing the game for just a few days and it's really boring. I'm disappointed.

Did you try to find out about the person that unleashed the dog that's so irresponsible?"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ,      3
sub_14_conv_8 ,I reported it to the police and they will try to find the person responsible with the cameras and everything but so far like like we don't have any news of about this so I would have to pay for my treatment which is expensive and also I won't be able to walk well or like I mean I need to take care of my leg for the next few weeks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ,that's so unfortunate and yeah I hope the police will find it it's so irresponsible is creating a lot of I mean you cannot go to work and you cannot also like walk well and everything is such a huge burden also physically and mentally I guess you cannot imagine that someone just like bite you in the middle of the street                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ,      3
