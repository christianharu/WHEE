classification_label: 1 (Seeking Empathy) 

Note: Although the utterance starts by expressing the speaker's own emotions and situation, the question at the end opens a door for the other person to share their feelings or situation, which could lead to a seeking of empathy. However, the primary goal seems to be sharing the speaker's positive emotions rather than directly seeking empathy for a negative situation. The classification could be nuanced, but based on the provided features and the context of seeking empathy for understanding and acknowledgment of one's emotions, this utterance leans towards seeking empathy due to the sharing of personal feelings and the inquiry about the other's situation.","The utterance expresses excitement and joy about not having exams, which indicates a positive emotional state.

classification_label: 2 

Note: Although the utterance seems to be more about sharing personal enthusiasm and asking a question, the act of asking about someone's favorite subject can be seen as a basic form of providing empathy by showing interest in the other person's feelings and experiences. However, it's a borderline case and could also be classified under ""None"" depending on the strictness of the criteria for providing empathy.
