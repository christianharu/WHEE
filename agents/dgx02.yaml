template: |-
  Classify an utterance based on the following empathy categories:

  - **Seeking Empathy (Label: 1)** - Defined as a wanting to be heard and understood. People need their negative feelings recognized and acknowledged in challenging situations and their positive emotions understood and vicariously shared
  - **Providing Empathy (Label: 2)** - Defined as experiencing and understanding the feelings and emotions (negative and positive) of another and communicating accordingly
  - **None (Label: 0)** - Conversations that do not seek or provide empathy. These are straightforward, fact-oriented utterances.

  Additionally, consider the following **empathy-related features** for classification:

  - **Arousal** (range: -1 to 1) - Reflects the emotional intensity of a person (-1 = very calm, 1 = highly aroused).
  - **Valence** (range: -1 to 1) - Indicates emotional polarity (-1 = very negative, 1 = very positive).
  - **Who** (range: [0, 1, 2]) - Identifies the subject of the conversation:
    - 0 = The person's main attention is on themselves (e.g., "I" or "we" pronoun).
    - 1 = The person's main attention is on the person their having the conversation with (e.g., "you" pronoun).
    - 2 = The person's main attention is on another person or topic.
  - **Sentiment** label - Identifies polarity:
    - negative = Negative sentiment.
    - positive = Positive sentiment.
    - neutral = Neutral sentiment.
  - **Emotional Reactions** (range: [0, 2]) - Measures emotional expressiveness in the person who could provide empathy response:
    - 0 = Does not allude to any emotion.
    - 1 = Weak (no explicit emotional label).
    - 2 = Strong (explicit emotional response, e.g., "I feel sad for you").
  - **Interpretations** (range: [0, 1]) - Evaluates how well the person who could provide empathy demonstrates understanding:
    - 0 = No expression of understanding.
    - 1 = Weak (generic acknowledgment, e.g., "I understand how you feel").
    - 2 = Strong (specific inference, e.g., "This must be terrifying" or descriptions of similar experiences).
  - **Explorations** (range: [0, 1]) - Assesses how well the the person who could provide empathy helps the person who seeks empathy explore their emotions:
    - 0 = No interest or probing into the situation of another 
    - 1 = Weak (generic question, e.g., "What happened?").
    - 2 = Strong (specific question, e.g., "Are you feeling alone right now?").
